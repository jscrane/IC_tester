# IC Tester

A simple chip tester for retro 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 or 16-pin chips, designed around an Arduino Uno, some resistors, a ZIF socket, and a couple of breadboards.

To use the code unmodified, wire up as follows:

16       |  A5        | Via 330 ohm resistor
7        |  11        | Direct to ZIF pin

16       |  +5V       | (Optional - see text of article)

Compile and upload sketch (tested on an Arduino Uno). Open the Serial Monitor, set baud rate to 115200, line ending: newline.

Follow prompts in the serial monitor. Specifically:

* L : lists all known chips
* S4, S6, S8 ... S16 : scan for chips with that many pins
* \<chip number\> : search for that chip
* T : test a chip previously found by searching

Not all tests have been verified by the author. Many are not exhaustive, but should be adequate to identify a chip, or to see
if its basic logic functions and output drivers are working.

Only connect pin 16 on the ZIF chip to +5V if your target chip expects power (Vcc) on that pin.

Chips are inserted at the **top** of the ZIF holder. That is, pin 1 is always in the same place.
